## Human Activity Recognition

A learning algorithm to predict human activity using the sensory data from cell phone. 
"README.txt" under datasets has all the necessary information regarding the backgroud and structure of the data. The original data is here  - http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Smartphone-Based+Recognition+of+Human+Activities+and+Postural+Transitions

The learning model is devised by a three layer neural network. The activation used in the model is Sigmoid function.
The model is trained for about 100 iterations with regularization parameter set to 1.

Training set accuracy ~ 97 percent

Test set accuracy ~ 94 percent
